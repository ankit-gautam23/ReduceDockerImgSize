Install Docker: If you haven't already, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can download Docker from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Install the Docker Java client library: You also need to install the Docker Java client library, which allows you to interact with Docker from Java. You can add the following dependency to your project's pom.xml file if you are using Maven:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.docker-java</groupId>
  <artifactId>docker-java</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.8</version>
</dependency>
Create a Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in a new directory, and add your application code to it. Here is an example Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
# Use a smaller base image
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-alpine

# Copy your application code to the container
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN ./gradlew build

# Set the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["java", "-jar", "build/libs/myapp.jar"]
Create a build.gradle file: Create a build.gradle file in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This file should contain the necessary build settings for your Java application.

Create a Java file: Save the Java code I provided in the previous answer in a file named ReduceImageSize.java.

Run the Java file: Compile and run the Java file using the Java compiler:

javac ReduceImageSize.java
java ReduceImageSize

This will build a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory, and then compress the image to reduce its size. The Java program will output the size of the image before and after compression. Note that you will need to replace the values in the Java code with the correct paths and image names for your application.

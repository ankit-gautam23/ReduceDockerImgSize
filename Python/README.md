Install Docker: If you haven't already, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can download Docker from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Install the Docker Python client: You also need to install the Docker Python client library, which allows you to interact with Docker from Python. You can install it using pip:

pip install docker

Create a Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in a new directory, and add your application code to it. Here is an example Dockerfile:

# Use a smaller base image
FROM python:3.9.2-alpine

# Copy your application code to the container
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Install any necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Set the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


Create a requirements.txt file: Create a file named requirements.txt in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This file should contain a list of any Python packages that your application depends on.

Run the Python script: Save the Python code I provided in the previous answer in a file named reduce_image_size.py, and run it using the Python interpreter:

This will build a Docker image using the Dockerfile and requirements.txt files in the current directory, and then compress the image to reduce its size. The script will output the size of the image before and after compression
